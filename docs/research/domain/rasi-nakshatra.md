# Research — Rāśi and Nakṣatra Characteristics

**Status:** research baseline — descriptive reference, not a prediction engine
**Created:** 2026-09-06
**Purpose:** collect the structural attributes, traditional significance, and implementation
notes needed for the rāśi/sign and nakṣatra reference layer.

## Reading and source policy

In Jyotiṣa, a rāśi is a 30° sector of the sidereal zodiac. A nakṣatra is a 13°20′ sector
of the same 360° circle; the usual 27-nakṣatra scheme gives four 3°20′ padas per
nakṣatra. Parāśara presents the nakṣatras as the fixed circle through which the moving
grahas pass, and the rāśi rising at birth as the lagna from which chart results are
judged (`SRC_BPHS`).

The rows below separate structural attributes, classical descriptive attributes, and
interpretive synthesis. The synthesis is a study aid, not a standalone verdict about a
person. Fields whose assignment varies by text or lineage must retain a source and rule
set in the database.

## Rāśi structure

| 2 | Taurus | Vṛṣabha | Earth | Fixed / Sthira | Feminine | Venus | Bull | Stabilisation, value, resources, embodiment |
| 3 | Gemini | Mithuna | Air | Dual / Dvisvabhāva | Masculine | Mercury | Twins | Exchange, language, learning, variety |
| 4 | Cancer | Karkaṭa | Water | Movable / Chara | Feminine | Moon | Crab | Protection, belonging, nourishment, memory |
| 5 | Leo | Siṃha | Fire | Fixed / Sthira | Masculine | Sun | Lion | Radiance, authorship, authority, creative expression |
| 6 | Virgo | Kanyā | Earth | Dual / Dvisvabhāva | Feminine | Mercury | Maiden | Discrimination, craft, service, repair |

| 12 | Pisces | Mīna | Water | Dual / Dvisvabhāva | Feminine | Jupiter | Fish | Synthesis, compassion, imagination, release |

### How the rāśi attributes work

- **Element** describes the medium: fire acts, earth consolidates, air connects and
  conceptualises, and water feels, protects, and absorbs.
- **Modality** describes movement: movable begins, fixed sustains, and dual signs
  mediate or adapt. Element and modality are independent.
- **Polarity** is a traditional masculine/feminine alternation beginning with Aries. It
  is a symbolic polarity, not a statement about a person's sex or identity.
- **Ruler** supplies the dispositor and the sign's operating style. A planet in a sign
  must be judged through the sign lord, dignity, strength, and house context.
- **Significance** changes with use. A sign on the lagna describes the field of body and
  identity; on a house cusp it colours the house; occupied by a planet it becomes that
  planet's environment; as the Moon sign it becomes a mental/emotional lens.

The existing `tbl_SignAttributes` design also includes direction, rising type, animal
class, kālapuruṣa body part, exaltation/debilitation points, and mūlatrikoṇa ranges.
These should remain separate attributes or rule rows. Rising type, day/night strength,
benefic/malefic sign character, animal class, and exact body-part mappings need a named
edition before seeding because later tables do not always agree.

### What a nakṣatra contributes

- The Moon's nakṣatra is the janma/tārā basis for Vimśottarī dasha and a major lens for
  temperament, habit, and timing.
- Any planet's nakṣatra gives it a finer field of expression than the rāśi alone. The
  nakṣatra lord becomes a key dispositor in interpretation and dasha sequencing.
- The pada narrows the position to 3°20′ and maps one-to-one to a navāṃśa, making it a
  technically important D9 bridge as well as a phonetic/naming unit in some traditions.
- Deity and symbol provide mythic and functional vocabulary; they are interpretive
  anchors, not independent chart verdicts.
- Gana, yoni, nadi, varṇa, and tattva belong mainly to matching and specialised rule
  sets. They should not be treated as universal personality labels.

## Implementation recommendations

1. Keep `tbl_SignAttributes` as the stable 12-row structural table. Put contested
   assignments in rule tables with `RuleSetId` and `SourceRefCode`.
2. Keep `tbl_Nakshatras` at 27 rows for the existing Vimśottarī implementation. Treat
   Abhijit as an optional alternative rule set rather than silently adding row 28.
3. Keep `tbl_NakshatraPadas` at 108 rows. Store sidereal range, parent nakṣatra, D1 rāśi,
   and D9 navāṃśa sign, and validate both independent pada-to-navāṃśa calculations.
4. Store deity, symbol, and descriptive significance with source metadata. Store
   compatibility taxonomies separately and mark their tradition dependence.
5. Keep KP sub-lord resolution separate: it subdivides nakṣatra space and must not be
   confused with the nakṣatra's Vimśottarī lord.

## Open research questions

- Which edition is canonical for rising type, day/night, animal class, and body-part
  mappings?
- ~~Which deity/symbol spellings and compatibility taxonomies should be seeded when
  editions disagree?~~ Resolved for Gana/Yoni/Nadi 2026-09-14: `SRC_VASUDEV_MATCHING_CHARTS`
  (migration 098) — see `reference-data-tables.md` and `docs/research/sources.md`. Varna
  turned out not to be a nakṣatra-level compatibility taxonomy at all (it's Rasi-level,
  already seeded); Tatva is still open — that book doesn't cover it.
- Should the UI expose the interpretive “core function” text, or only sourced fields?
- Should an alternative 28-nakṣatra/Abhijit rule set be represented in the schema?
- Which named source covers Tatva (Prithvi/Jal/Agni/Vayu/Akash) per nakṣatra? Not part of
  either Kuta scheme (8-factor or 10-factor) in `SRC_VASUDEV_MATCHING_CHARTS`.
