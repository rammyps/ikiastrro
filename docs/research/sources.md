# Reference sources — citation registry (`SRC_*`)

The single place classical texts, libraries, and external exports are named. Everything else
(rule tables, terminology, specs, plans, code comments) cites the `Code` — never the title or
author inline (`STANDARDS.md §M.4`). Mirrored into `dbo.tbl_Dim_Source` by
`db/15_create_dim_source.sql` / the `seed-sources` path; keep the two in sync.

**Primary reference (2026-09-04, rammyps): `SRC_PVR_INTEGRATED`.** The project is being
reconciled chapter-by-chapter against P.V.R. Narasimha Rao's *Vedic Astrology: An Integrated
Approach* — it is the canonical spine for engine behaviour, rule values, and terminology, and
its `SRC_*` code is what a `tbl_Rule_*` row cites for the whole PVR corpus even where the same
material appears in a derivative (a worksheet, JHora, a later article). Other `SRC_*` rows stay
as cross-checks or for areas the book doesn't cover. Where the shipped code deliberately differs
from the book, that is called out at the divergence (row `CalculationNarrative`, or a spec
note), never left silent. Coverage / reconciliation status per chapter:
`docs/research-pvr-book-coverage.md`.

Add a row the same change that first cites a new source. A chapter/verse-scoped code
(`SRC_BPHS_27`) is preferred over the umbrella (`SRC_BPHS`) once the location is confirmed.

## House-placement comparison evidence (2026-09-07)

Evidence keys are passage locators, not new SRC codes or database source rows. They support
[the comparison note](../research-house-placement-pvr-raman.md).

`SRC_PVR_INTEGRATED`: consulted the registered local raw extract; author-hosted discovery
page: [Astrology resources](https://www.vedicastrologer.org/articles/).

| Key | Passage |
|---|---|
| PVR-H1 | Chapter 7 sections 7.1–7.2, printed pp. 67–69: house counting and twelve-house meanings; 7.2 explicitly refers readers to Raman volumes I–II for further house results. |

`SRC_RAMAN_HTJH`: Volume I prose consulted from the finalised extract
`D:\@ClaudeSpace\BookExtracts\how-to-judge-a-horoscope-1.md`, rather than the old `_work`
path in the source table. Printed pages differ from the extract's scan PAGE markers.
Chart-grid transcription is not used as evidence in this comparison.
