# Reference sources — citation registry (`SRC_*`)

The single place classical texts, libraries, and external exports are named. Everything else
(rule tables, terminology, specs, plans, code comments) cites the `Code` — never the title or
author inline (`STANDARDS.md §M.4`). Mirrored into `dbo.tbl_Dim_Source` by
`db/15_create_dim_source.sql` / the `seed-sources` path; keep the two in sync.

**Primary reference (2026-09-04, rammyps): `SRC_PVR_INTEGRATED`.** The project is being
reconciled chapter-by-chapter against P.V.R. Narasimha Rao's *Vedic Astrology: An Integrated
Approach* — it is the canonical spine for engine behaviour, rule values, and terminology, and
its `SRC_*` code is what a `tbl_Rule_*` row cites for the whole PVR corpus even where the same
material appears in a derivative (a worksheet, JHora, a later article). Other `SRC_*` rows stay
as cross-checks or for areas the book doesn't cover. Where the shipped code deliberately differs
from the book, that is called out at the divergence (row `CalculationNarrative`, or a spec
note), never left silent. Coverage / reconciliation status per chapter:
`docs/research-pvr-book-coverage.md`.

## 2026-09-13 reconciliation — local library cross-check (migration 088)

Every `SRC_*` code appearing anywhere in `docs/` or `src/` was diffed against `dbo.tbl_Dim_Source`
(zero gaps after this pass) and, separately, every row was checked against the physical library at
`D:\Vedic Astrology\Vedic Astology Books` (opened and read — not matched by filename alone — before
citing anything below):

- **Fixed real data corruption**: `SRC_BPHS_ASHTAKAVARGA` and `SRC_BPHS_GRAHA_SVARUPA` had
  mojibake'd em dashes/diacritics baked into the live dev DB (apply-time corruption — the
  originating `.sql` files themselves were correct UTF-8 — same class of bug documented in
  migrations 086/087: `sqlcmd` run without `-f 65001`).
- **Captured 3 rows not backed by any workstream/database migration**: `SRC_BPHS_GRAHA_SVARUPA`,
  `SRC_TB_1_5_1_NAKSHATRAS`, `SRC_HOROSCOPE_EXPLORER` exist in the shared dev DB only because
  `master` independently reused migration numbers 071/072/076 for unrelated content, applied
  against the same local SQL Server instance both branches build against. Re-asserted here via
  idempotent `MERGE` so this branch's own migration history reproduces them without depending on
  `master`.
- **Registered 2 previously doc-only codes**: `SRC_BRIHAT_JATAKA_1` and `SRC_BPHS_34_45` were
  cited in `docs/research/domain/rasi-nakshatra.md` but had no `tbl_Dim_Source` row (neither is
  used as a live `SourceRefCode` value anywhere, so this never broke `verify-sources` — both were
  dangling doc references).
- **Added confirmed local-file paths** to 6 rows that previously lacked them:
  `SRC_PVR_INTEGRATED`, `SRC_BPHS`, `SRC_PHALADEEPIKA`, `SRC_RATH_VARGA`, `SRC_RAMAN_HTJH`,
  `SRC_RAMAN_300_COMBINATIONS`.
- **Checked but found no local match**: `SRC_RAMAN_HINDU_PREDICTIVE` (B. V. Raman's *Hindu
  Predictive Astrology*) — no file under this title in the library; a similarly-named
  `Essentials of Predictive Hindu Astrology.pdf` exists but is a different work, not assumed to be
  the same book.
- **Known gap, not fixed here** (pre-existing, documented in `life-matter-reference-pvr.md`):
  `verify-sources` crashes on `research.tbl_Dim_SourceReferencePlanetText`
  (schema-qualification bug) before it can validate anything past that point. Independently of
  that bug, the isolated `research.*` corpus (migration 056+) stores citation metadata inline per
  row rather than via an FK to `dbo.tbl_Dim_Source` — its `SourceRefCode` values (e.g.
  `SRC_PHALADEEPIKA_PLANETS`, `SRC_BVRAMAN_PLANET_IN_HOUSE`) are not expected to resolve against
  this table at all, by design. A future fix should schema-qualify the scan *and* skip the
  isolated-research schema rather than trying to validate it against this registry.

See `db/088_reconcile_source_references_with_local_library.sql` for the exact statements.

Add a row the same change that first cites a new source. A chapter/verse-scoped code
(`SRC_BPHS_27`) is preferred over the umbrella (`SRC_BPHS`) once the location is confirmed.

## House-placement comparison evidence (2026-09-07)

Evidence keys are passage locators, not new SRC codes or database source rows. They support
[the comparison note](../research-house-placement-pvr-raman.md).

`SRC_PVR_INTEGRATED`: consulted the registered local raw extract; author-hosted discovery
page: [Astrology resources](https://www.vedicastrologer.org/articles/).

| Key | Passage |
|---|---|
| PVR-H1 | Chapter 7 sections 7.1–7.2, printed pp. 67–69: house counting and twelve-house meanings; 7.2 explicitly refers readers to Raman volumes I–II for further house results. |
| PVR-H2 | Chapter 7 sections 7.3–7.4, printed pp. 69–77: divisional context, reference lagnas, planetary references and relative-house categories. |
| PVR-H3 | Chapter 7 section 7.5, printed pp. 77–78: whole-sign recommendation and explicit rejection of the described Bhava/chalit alternatives. |
| PVR-H4 | Chapter 13 section 13.4.1, printed pp. 169–170: chart, house, reference, arudha, influences, standard placement results and strength/avastha/yoga modifiers. |

`SRC_RAMAN_HTJH`: Volume I prose consulted from the finalised extract
`D:\@ClaudeSpace\BookExtracts\how-to-judge-a-horoscope-1.md`, rather than the old `_work`
path in the source table. Printed pages differ from the extract's scan PAGE markers.
Chart-grid transcription is not used as evidence in this comparison.

| Key | Passage |
|---|---|
| RAM-H0 | Volume I, General Introduction, printed pp. 3–4 (scan 12–13): conditional interpretation and twelve-house meanings. |
| RAM-H1 | Volume I, Considerations in Judging a House, printed pp. 5–6 (scan 14–15): eight-factor checklist, modifying influences and period activation. |
| RAM-H2 | Volume I, Concerning the First House, printed pp. 20–21 (scan 29–30): distinction between Bhava and Rasi; Navamsa; house, lord, occupants and karaka. |
| RAM-H3 | Volume I, first-lord placements, printed pp. 21–23 (scan 30–32); fifth-lord placements, printed pp. 205–206 (scan 214–215). |
| RAM-H4 | Volume I, Planets in the First House, printed pp. 39–41 (scan 48–50); Planets in the Third House, printed pp. 129–130 (scan 138–139). |

Volume II source supplied 2026-09-07:
`D:\Vedic Astrology\Vedic Astology Books\B. V. Raman\How to Judje a Horoscope - II.djvu`.
Full-scan OCR destination: `D:\@ClaudeSpace\BookExtracts\how-to-judge-a-horoscope-2-ocr.md`.
Extraction completed: 482/482 pages, no failed or empty pages. Full OCR is a draft; selected rule passages were checked against scans. Volume II is Fourth Edition, Delhi, 1992, Motilal Banarsidass, ISBN 81-208-0845-2, as recorded on scan page 2. Edition metadata is read from OCR; this is not a new database source record.
