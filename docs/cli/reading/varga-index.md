# Reference — Varga Reading Index (charts without a full guide yet)

Every divisional chart the `ikiastrro` engine computes, with the short version of *how to
read it*. The four charts with full guides — **D1**
([`d1-rasi.md`](d1-rasi.md)), **D9**
([`d9-navamsa.md`](d9-navamsa.md)), **D10**
([`d10-dasamsa.md`](d10-dasamsa.md)), **D60**
([`d60-shashtiamsa.md`](d60-shashtiamsa.md)) — are not
repeated here.

Read [`method.md`](method.md) for the
universal loop. Calculation rules and their sources:
[`../calculations.md`](../calculations.md) §2 and
[`../gap-and-coverage.md`](../gap-and-coverage.md) §2.

**As of:** 2026-09-01. **Status:** living. Each row marked `full guide: TODO` is a
candidate for its own `reference-chart-d<NN>-<name>.md` on the same pattern as the four
above.

---

## How to use a row

For each varga: (1) form the D1 verdict for its subject; (2) run the universal loop —
varga Lagna + its lord, the subject house(s) and lord(s) below, the natural karaka, then
Vargottama / dignity / yoga; (3) confirm against **D60**. The "read in order" column is
the specialisation of loop step 7 for that chart.

**Strength groups:** `6` Shadvarga · `7` Saptavarga · `10` Dashavarga · `16`
Shodashavarga. A dash = not in any classical strength grouping (picked for life-area
coverage; does not feed Vimsopaka).

## The charts

### D2 — Hora · wealth

- **JHora grid:** `D-2 (US)`. **N = 2.** **Groups:** 6·7·10·16.
- **Method:** **Uma-Shambhu** 12-sign Hora (`HoraD2UmaShambu`, PyJHora `chart_method=1`),
  the same as JHora's export — the Sun's hora always in an odd sign, the Moon's in an even one,
  `(2r + h) mod 12`. Since migration 164 ([decision 005](../../../decisions/005-d2-d3-d7-jhora-default-schemes.md));
  the classical Leo/Cancer Hora of decision D-1 is retired. `D2-US` now equals `D2`.
- **Read for:** wealth, liquid resources, family prosperity, sustenance.
- **Read in order:** which Hora (Sun's = self-earned/active wealth; Moon's =
  inherited/passive/fluctuating) holds the Lagna and the Moon → 2nd and 11th lords of D1
  in D2 → Jupiter (dhana karaka) and Venus in D2 → benefics vs malefics in the wealth
  Horas.

  signs backward.
